# Project Build Instructions

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the Makefile for building and managing the project.

## Overview

The Makefile included in this project automates the process of compiling the source code, linking the binaries, and cleaning up the build files. It ensures that all dependencies are properly managed and that the build process is consistent across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before running the make commands, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- GCC compiler (or another compatible compiler)
- Any other necessary libraries or tools specific to the project

## Commands

The Makefile supports the following commands:

- `make`: Compiles the source files and links them to create the final executable.
- `make clean`: Removes all the object files and the executable created by the build process.
- `make install`: Installs the executable to the specified location (if applicable).
- `make test`: Runs any tests associated with the project (if applicable).

## Usage

To build the project, simply navigate to the directory containing the Makefile and type:

```bash
make
